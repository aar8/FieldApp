/**
 * ### `object_metadata`
 *
 * **Purpose**: This table serves as the central schema definition for each business object within the system, identified by the `object_name` column (e.g., "job", "customer"). It defines the complete set of fields‚Äîboth core system fields and tenant-defined custom fields‚Äîthat constitute the data structure for that object.
 *
 * **Structure**:
 * - `object_name`: Specifies the target business object (e.g., "job", "customer", "invoice") whose fields are being defined.
 * - `data` (JSON): Contains a structured definition (e.g., an array or map) describing each field associated with the `object_name`. Each field definition includes attributes such as:
 *   - `field_name`: The key used within the main data table's JSON blob.
 *   - `data_type`: The expected data type (e.g., "text", "number", "date", "boolean", "lookup").
 *   - `label`: The user-facing display name for the field.
 *   - `is_required`: Boolean indicating if the field must have a value.
 *   - `is_core_field`: Boolean indicating if it's a standard system field or a custom addition.
 *   - Other properties like display order, help text, or validation rules.
 *
 * **Role in System**: This table is the single source of truth for the structure of business objects. It is read by various system components:
 * 1.  **Dynamic UI Engine**: Uses these definitions to render appropriate input fields, labels, and layouts in the client applications.
 * 2.  **Validation Logic**: Enforces data types and required field rules based on these definitions before saving data.
 * 3.  **Sync Engine**: May use this metadata to understand the structure of data being synchronized.
 * 4.  **API Layers**: Can use this to provide schema information to integrators.
 *
 * By centralizing the field definitions here, the system supports dynamic rendering, validation, and extensibility (adding new fields) without requiring changes to the core database table schemas.

 * ### `layout_definitions`
 *
 * **Purpose**: This table defines the visual structure and content (the layout) for displaying records in the user interface. It dictates which fields are shown, how they are grouped into sections, and in what order they appear. Crucially, it allows the UI to dynamically adapt based on the specific context of the record being viewed.
 *
 * **Structure**:
 * - `object_name`: Specifies the target business object (e.g., "job", "customer") whose layout is being defined.
 * - `object_type`: Specifies the sub-type of the object (e.g., "job_residential", "job_commercial", or a default like "*").
 * - `status`: Specifies the record status (e.g., "scheduled", "in_progress", or a default like "*").
 * - `data` (JSON): Contains the actual layout definition, structured as follows:
 *   - `sections`: An array of `LayoutSection` objects. Each section represents a distinct grouping of fields in the UI.
 *     - `label`: The user-visible title for the section (e.g., "Job Details", "Customer Information").
 *     - `fields`: An ordered array of field names. These names correspond to the `field_name` definitions found in the `object_metadata` table for the given `object_name`. The order in this array dictates the display order within the section.
 *
 * **Role in System**: This table is the blueprint for the UI.
 * 1.  **Dynamic UI Engine**: When displaying a record, the client application queries this table using the record's specific `object_name`, `object_type`, and `status`.
 * 2.  **Layout Selection**: The system finds the most specific matching `layout_definitions` record (using default "*" values if an exact match isn't found).
 * 3.  **Rendering**: The client then uses the `data` JSON (the `sections` and ordered `fields` arrays) from the selected layout record, combined with the field definitions from `object_metadata`, to dynamically construct and render the appropriate user interface on the screen.
 *
 * By binding layouts to this compound key (`object_name`, `object_type`, `status`), the system can present entirely different views and available fields for the same type of object depending on its specific state and classification (e.g., an "In Progress Residential Job" layout vs. a read-only "Completed Commercial Job" layout). üé®
